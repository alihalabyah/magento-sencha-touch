and Jurgen [forgot his name]â€¦ but it was his idea in the first place!

Anyway. The module consists of the following:

* Controllers that spit out JSON category and product data
* MagentoSenchaApp that sits in /m/ that consumes the JSON data and manipulates its own index.html
* Access the mobile front end from www.domain.com/m/index.html


Obviously, this is just a start.
